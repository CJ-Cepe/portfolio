## Future Improvements
* Accessibility Improvement: Make site more accessible.
    * Compliant with WCAG & WAI-ARIA.
    * Compatible with assistive technologies.
* Web Browsers: The portfolio has been tested on the latest versions of Chrome & Edge (Chromium browser).
    * Plan to improve support for older versions. (babel)
    * Aim to ensure compatibility with other browser vendors - Mozilla, Safari, etc.
* Projects: Iâ€™m still in the process of recovering some of my project files and assets.
* Optimize resouces/assets: currently, images are in webp format and videos are compressed mp4.
    * Plan to provide images in various sizes and formats, as fallback.
    * Videos experience a few seconds of delay before playing when hosted.
* Hover fallback/alternative for mobile.
* Spline: initially the plan is to use 3d objs, instead of 2d emojis, using spline. However, there is a problem with performance.
